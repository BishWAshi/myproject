### Stepper Motors Math

#What value to put into GRBL for steps?
A typical stepper motor has 200 steps PER revolution. These are known as FULL steps or 1.8Â° per step. This setting has the most torque and is the fastest, however not the smoothest.
Most of these machines will list the kind and size of lead/ballscrew it has. On my 3020, the lead screw is 1404.
14: 14mm diameter of the screw thread (OD)
04: 4mm pitch (or the distance between threads)
We are mostly concerned with the 04 number since it describes the amount of linear travel something connected to the lead screw will travel with ONE revolution. So a 1205 thread is 12mm diameter and 5mm thread size, so on and so forth. This also applies to ball screws, 1603 is 16mm diameter and 3mm thread size.

Now we can connect the two numbers together.
Stepper: 200/rev
Leadscrew: 4mm/rev
The settings in GRBL call for a PER mm number so its a simple math really.
200/4 = 50 steps to make something travel 1mm
(if we have a 3mm thread, it would be 200/3 etc etc)
50 is the number I put in GRBL

Heres where we get fancy, micro stepping.
I have my CNC machine set up to be 1/8 micro stepping, which means each step is divided into 8 microsteps.
200 steps x 8 micro steps = 1600 total steps/rev
The same math applies
1600/4 = 400 steps to make something move 1mm (again, if your thread is different, than the divider number will be different)
400 is the number I put into GRBL

The more steps the smoother the motions, but slower it will be and less power on the torque.
THANKFULLY, the Chinese CNC machines are all metric, which makes this math very simple. If these were ACME threads, there would be some metric/imperial conversions which would result in some very odd numbers.
