Asean Market:: Schneider Electric
=================================

1. Existing Available products in the market is less than AB/Siemens 
so less experise in the field of automation

2. HMI /SCADA - Red Lion/ Wonderware is popular chice - 
so Schneider has good products in their bag 

3. Schneider Altivar drives are short lived, they become obsolete very quicker than 
AB/Siemens/ABB. Schneider change their lines too much

4. Schneider's software for Square-D, Telemecanique is lacking, support is non-existent.

5. Schneider's PLC tech support is free within 24h, 
-all their ethernet based devices (plcs, drives) have built in web servers and have for years
-most ethernet products have dual ports (allowing easy ring type configuration
- all the current plcs use a single programming package (UnityPro)
- this same programming package is used to setup all the communications
- this same programming package has built in DTM/FDT capability (useful for setting up instrumentation devices etc)
- UnityPro has user defined types and user defined function blocks that are even editable online (to a degree) (AB only discovered Add On function blocks recently and they are still not editable online)
- UnityPro supports all 5 IEC languages (FB, LAD, ST, IL, SFC) within the standard package
- IO scanning function allows communication networks to be setup by simply filling out a configuration table (no plc code to write). This can be used to communicate with other plcs, drives and io devices
- PLCs (ethernet) have built in DHCP servers and a FDR (faulty device replacement) capability which saves and can restore ethernet devices configuration
-natively supports ModbusTCP, EthernetIP, Profibus, Can, Modbus
- etc etc



6.annual Tech support is fees is too  much
7. Schneider's Unity Pro software is slow
