To navigate into the root directory, use "cd /"

To navigate to your home directory, use "cd" or "cd ~"

To navigate up one directory level, use "cd .."

To navigate to the previous directory (or back), use "cd -"

cp: The cp command will make a copy of a file for you
mv: The mv command will move a file to a different location or will rename a file. Examples are as follows: "mv file foo" will rename the file "file" to "foo". "mv foo ~/Desktop" will move the file "foo" to your Desktop directory, but it will not rename it. You must specify a new file name to rename a file.

rm: Use this command to remove or delete a file in your directory.
rmdir: The rmdir command will delete an empty directory. To delete a directory and all of its contents recursively, use rm -r instead.
mkdir: The mkdir command will allow you to create directories. Example: "mkdir music" will create a directory called "music".
